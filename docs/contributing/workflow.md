# Contributing

## Workflow

For everything, `turbo` and `yarn` are used. To build a specific app/package, go into the directory of said app/package and run `yarn build`. To build, lint, and test all apps, run `turbo run lint build test`. If you instead run `turbo run lint && turbo run test && turbo run build`, `turbo` will be unable to schedule it's work smartly and take less time, which it does when running the reccomended way.
