## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if pull requests are merged, the following things are looked at:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't state anything about why you're doing that. Rather;

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always

    look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

This shows the changes that were done and why it was done

### Is it of good quality

-   The code has comments describing any new features that the code implements,
    so that others can understand the code well
-   Is the code split into small commits with small changes so it can be easily changed,
    or is it in one chunk, which can make it hard to trace where bugs were introduced

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Discussions, pull requests, or issues that do not respect it will be removed.
