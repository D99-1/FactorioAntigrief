This repository is a monorepo that houses the entire FAGC project.

FAGC is a free and open-source software project that aims to provide a centralized banlist for Factorio server owners and players, with the aim
of synchronizing the banlist across servers with some specific filters. If you don't know much about the project and would like to know more,
please check out [About FAGC](#about-fagc)
